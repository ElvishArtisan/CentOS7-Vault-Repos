# Long-term repository definitions for CentOS 7
These respository definitions have been modified to point to the
"reference" repos at http://vault.centos.org, and should thus be
suitable for long-term use.

## Security Warning
CentOS 7 hit end-of-life on 30 June 2024. The packages in these
repos were frozen at that time. No security updates have been
applied since that date!
